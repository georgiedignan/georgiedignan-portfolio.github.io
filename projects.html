                        analysis into the feasibility of using solar PV cooling for an underground mine. Whilst completing a summer
                        semester at Harvard in 2019, I extended this to a compelete sustainability analysis (including economic, 
                        environmental and social factors).

                    <p class="author">Michael Bell, Anuj Dhorajiwala, Georgie Dignan, Daniel Mactaggart 2021</p>
                    <p class="project_desc">This project is a business case challenge that is part of the BHP Graduate program.
                        Haulage circuits employ two main strategies for cribbing, these are common crib and hot seating. Cribbing
                        strategies are selected without data driven insights into the comparative performance measures (on prodduction
                        and cost level) for each strategy. The project was create create a tool to model these varying input paramaters
                        with the aim of optimising hot seating strategy to reduce off-circuit travel time.
